## What it is ##
With KODI Popcorn Time you can search for Movies, TV Shows and Animes that you can see immediately in KODI.

I do this as a hobby and release it for free. But if you like it and want to you can always buy me a beer using the PayPal donation button on my [Developer Github Page](https://markop159.github.io), or donate via Bitcoin QR code on bottom of the page.
